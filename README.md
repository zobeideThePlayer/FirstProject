# FirstProject
First project to learn the basics of Github. I am following the guide on [This Link](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-git-and-github-6fcd0f2d4ac6)

  1) creating a new repository
  2) editing the readme.md (A great tutorial on how to write mark-down or md file can be found at [This Link](https://agea.github.io/tutorial.md/))
